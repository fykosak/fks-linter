# Usage

    git clone https://github.com/fykosak/fks-linter.git
    cd fks-linter
    ./fks-linter <file-to-check

# Design

  - parsing is based on events (see SAX parsers for XML)
  - checkers register handlers for the events and perform various checks
  - each event comes with `context` that consists of
    - character no
    - line no
    - character no on line
      - `colno` is 1-based
      - `colidx` is 0-based
    - current line
  - for existing events and their optional arguments see class `fks.linter.Event`

  -  high-level arg
    - in math mode

# Implemented checkers #

  - line length
  - eq is indented
  - whitespace at end of line
  - no \left(, \right)
  - {} after \dots
  
# TODO

  - checkers
    - sentence begins on new line?
    - eq is part of sentence
    - missing ~
    - correctly formatted labels of objects
    - dot at the end od caption
    - \lbl in equations
    - all \lbl (equations) are referenced
    - equations are referenced by \eqref, other by \ref
    - all references are cross file only
    - check that solution doesn't end in equation
    - \eq[m] without & on each (TeX) row
    - check "macro (no comma, one space or no unit; except \micro)
      - comma is supported for backward compatibility only
    - no $$, equation, eqnarray, align
    - space every 3 digits
    - space \, after equation
    - no white space at the solution, task, footnote ... beginning
    - probname, probsolauthor,... on one line
    - % at the end of task, solution
    - no space before footnote macro
    - no braces for one-letter index
    - closing brace of task, solution,... on separate line
    - no tabulator
    - no indentation of the text
  - switch on/off individual checkers on CLI
  - various severity levels of linting errors
  - colorized output
  - (optionally) print context of linting errors
